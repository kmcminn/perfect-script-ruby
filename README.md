Perfect Script (ruby)
===================
a template for the perfect ruby script.

## About
There's a long history in my hunt for a perfect scripts. See the [commentary](https://github.com/kmcminn/perfect-script-ruby/blob/master/COMMENTARY.md) if you're interetsed in the notes in the hyper line-by-line optimization. enjoy!

Please open an issue if you have any ideas on how to improve it! 

Goals:

* self documenting
* no obtuse dependencies
* easily reusable:
   * via copy/paste
   * via modules/inheritance/etc
* idiomatic 
* usuable as a single file
* usable by a junior sysadmin and senior software engineer
