Perfect Script (ruby)
===================
a template for the perfect ruby script.

## About
The hunt for a perfect script has its origin in a bash code review. Its evolved a bit since then to this amazing piece of awesomesauce. enjoy.

Please open an issue if you have any ideas on how to improve it! 

Goals:

* self documenting
* no obtuse dependencies
* easily reusable:
   * via copy/paste
   * via modules/inheritance/etc
* idiomatic 
* usuable as a single file
* usable by a junior sysadmin and senior software engineer
